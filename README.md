# Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists - CSC 262 Module 3

## Description
This project demonstrates the differences between Arrays and ArrayLists in Java. It includes examples of how to use both data structures, highlighting their respective advantages and limitations.

## Functions and Conceptual Differences

### Arrays
Arrays are a fundamental data structure in Java that store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. Each element is accessed via an index.

- **Fixed Size:** The size is determined at creation and cannot be changed.
- **Type-Specific:** All elements must be of the same type.
- **Index-Based:** Access elements using their index, starting from 0.

### ArrayLists
ArrayLists are part of Java's Collection Framework and provide a more flexible, dynamically resizable array-like structure.

- **Dynamic Size:** Automatically resizes when elements are added or removed.
- **Type Safety with Generics:** Can store any type of objects, specified using generics.
- **Rich API:** Provides methods for manipulating the list, such as adding, removing, and searching elements.****
